******** DEPENDENCIES:
As of version 0.10, [convolve~] requires FFTW 3.3.5 or greater, available at http://www.fftw.org.

FFTW is included pre-compiled with convolve~'s Windows binary package available via deken. Simply leave libfftw3f-3.dll in the convolve~ directory for use as a shared library. For Linux and Macintosh, the FFTW library is statically linked with the convolve~ binary file, so there is no need for compiling or obtaining FFTW if you installed convolve~ via deken.


******** COMPILING FFTW:
If you are compliling FFTW yourself, it must be done in single precision for use with convolve~. To do so in Linux, configure FFTW like this:

./configure CFLAGS="-fPIC" --enable-float

and like this on a Macintosh:

./configure CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" --enable-float

and like this on a Raspberry Pi:

./configure CFLAGS="-fPIC" --enable-float

Then execute:

make
sudo make install

On Linux and Macintosh, the FFTW library files should be installed to /usr/local/lib by default.


******** COMPILING CONVOLVE~ FOR LINUX AND MACOS:
Once FFTW is properly built and installed, you can compile convolve~ using the included Makefile by executing:

make

On Linux and Macintosh, convolve~ will be statically linked the FFTW library.


******** COMPILING CONVOLVE~ FOR WINDOWS:
convolve~ can be compiled on Windows with the included Makefile if you use MSYS2/MinGW: https://www.msys2.org/ and install base development tools as described in the MSYS2 installation guide.

You will first need to install The FFTW library for Windows, which is available precompiled at:

http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html

The fftw-3.3.5-dll64.zip file contains headers and several compiled versions of FFTW, but only fftw3.h and libfftw3f-3.dll are required for convolve~. Place fftw3.h in your msys64/usr/local/include directory, and libfftw3f-3.dll in your msys64/usr/local/lib directory. Because the Windows version of the FFTW library is named differently than the Linux and MacOS versions, you'll have to make one edit to the Makefile, appending "-3" to the end of the library name on this line:

ldlibs = -L/usr/local/lib -lfftw3f-3

Finally, place a copy of libfftw3f-3.dll in the same directory containing convolve~.dll, and convolve~ should run successfully in Pd.
