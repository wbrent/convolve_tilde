As of version 0.10, [convolve~] requires FFTW 3.3.5 or greater, available at http://www.fftw.org.

FFTW is included pre-compiled with convolve~'s Windows binary package available through deken. It's fine to simply leave libfftw3f-3.dll in the convolve~ directory for use as a shared library. For Linux and Macintosh, FFTW is statically linked with the convolve~ binary file, so there is no need for compiling or obtaining FFTW.

If you are compliling FFTW yourself, it must be compiled in single precision for use with convolve~. To do so in Linux, configure FFTW like this:

./configure CFLAGS="-fPIC" --enable-float

and like this on a Macintosh:

./configure CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" --enable-float

and like this on a Raspberry Pi:

./configure CFLAGS="-fPIC" --enable-float

Then run:

make
sudo make install

On Linux and Macintosh, the FFTW library files should be installed to /usr/local/lib by default. Once FFTW is properly built and installed, you can make convolve~ using the included Makefile by running:

make

Compilation of convolve~ from source on Windows can be done with the same Makefile if you use MinGW: http://www.mingw.org

On Linux and Macintosh, convolve~ will statically link the FFTW library. On Windows, you will either have to set up an environment variable to point to the location of libfftw3f-3.dll, or simply put libfftw3f-3.dll directly in the convolve~ directory.

The FFTW library for Windows is available precompiled at:

http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html

You will need the 32-bit version, and the single precision version specifically. The provided zip file contains several compiled versions of FFTW, but only libfftw3f-3.dll is required for convolve~ version 0.10.
